You will be given a caption describing the {contents_modality}. Your task is to generate a hard negative caption using the criteria below:

***
[Generation Criteria]
1. Ensure the new caption has higher similarity to the {contents_modality} in {contents_modality}-text crossmodal model than the given caption.
2. Introduce a contradiction compared to the given caption, but avoid simple negations (e.g., using words like "no", "not", "empty", or "without").
3. Make fewer than {max_word_distance_plus_one} word-level changes (add, delete, or substitute words) to the given caption without fully rewriting it to generate the new caption.

[Given Caption]
- {caption}

Write only the new caption starting with "Generated Caption: ", without explanation.
