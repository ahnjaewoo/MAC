You will be given a caption describing the {contents_modality}. Your task is to generate a hard negative caption based on the "attribute swapping" scenario using the criteria below:

***
[Generation Criteria]
1. First locate two swappable adjectives in the given caption describing different objects, and then swap them to make a new caption (e.g., from "a red apple and a purple grape" to "a purple apple and a red grape").
2. Ensure the new caption has higher similarity to the {contents_modality} in {contents_modality}-text crossmodal model than the given caption.
3. Introduce a contradiction compared to the given caption, but avoid simple negations (e.g., using words like "no", "not", "empty", or "without").
4. Make fewer than {max_word_distance_plus_one} word-level changes (swap words) to the given caption without fully rewriting it to generate the new caption.

[Given Caption]
- {caption}

Write only the new caption starting with "Generated Caption: ", without explanation.
