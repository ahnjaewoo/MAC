You will be given a caption describing the {contents_modality}. Your task is to generate a hard negative caption based on the "object replacement" scenario using the criteria below:

***
[Generation Criteria]
1. Replace a key object in the given caption with a new object that is not in the given caption.
2. Ensure the new caption has higher similarity to the {contents_modality} in {contents_modality}-text crossmodal model than the given caption.
3. Introduce a contradiction compared to the given caption, but avoid simple negations (e.g., using words like "no", "not", "empty", or "without").
4. Make fewer than {max_word_distance_plus_one} word-level changes (substitute words) to the given caption without fully rewriting it to generate the new caption.

[Given Caption]
- {caption}
***

Write only the new caption starting with "Generated Caption: ", without explanation.
